# Custom_Tkinter_Project

## Making a currency converter GUI using data form the National Bank of Poland using custom_tkinter

In this project I tackled the task of creating a GUI thst lets the user convert currencies. The obvious choice for the library was tkinter, yet I decided on using custom_tkinter insted, becouse it has a more of a modern look as opposed to classic tkinter.


## Usage

In order to try the program yourself, clone the code of this projeckt to a directory on your device. After that run the folowing command on a command prompt of your choise (make sure you are in the directory to which you downlowded the code).

```bash
python main.py
```
## Requirements
Many libraries used in this project do not come preinstalled in vanilla python. In order to get the program running you might need to run the following command in the command prompt (again make sure you are in the directory to which you downlowded the code).

```bash
pip install -r requriements.txt
```

## Project state
This project is finished.
